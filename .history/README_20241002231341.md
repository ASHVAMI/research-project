## Project Description
This project aims to address the challenges outlined in the selected research paper by proposing a unique solution that utilizes [mention your techniques, e.g., deep learning, ensemble learning, or new algorithm]. The solution is implemented using Python and relevant libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. The results of the solution are compared with existing models and algorithms.

## Research Paper
- **Title:** [Title of Your Paper]
- **Journal:** [Journal Name]
- **DOI:** [DOI number]
- **Link:** [Link to the paper]

The paper is downloaded and analyzed to identify key methodologies and gaps in the current work. These insights are used to develop a novel solution for the research problem.

## Solution Overview
The solution I propose is based on [brief explanation of your algorithm/solution]. The key components of the solution are:
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
- **Model Development**: Using [mention models/algorithms used].
- **Evaluation**: Testing the performance of the model using accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
- **Visualizations**: Using data visualizations to highlight results and insights.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset used in this project comes from [mention dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI repository]. Data preprocessing includes steps such as:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Normalization/Standardization

The dataset file can be found in the `data/` folder. The preprocessing script is located in the `src/preprocessing.py`.

## Model Development
The core model is developed using [mention the algorithm used, e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks, etc.]. The model development is performed in the `src/model.py` script.

Key steps:
1. Load and split the data
2. Train the model
3. Save and export the model for further evaluation

## Evaluation
After training the model, it is evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation script is found in `src/evaluate.py`. A comparative analysis with the existing solutions from the research paper is also included.

## Visualizations
Visualizations are crucial for understanding the results. The following visualizations are generated:
- **Confusion Matrix**: To assess classification performance
- **Feature Importance**: To identify important features in the model
- **Accuracy Curve**: To show training/testing accuracy over epochs

Visualizations are generated in the `src/visualization.py` file and saved in the `output/visualizations/` directory.
